# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project was motivated by a desire to clean up existing code and make it more accessible. In its prior condition, the code was confusing to read through and
not properly organized into specific html semantic elements. The CSS file also needed work, so it has been updated to more properly reflect the organization of the html. 
The website will now be much easier to maintain and upgrade in the future without confusion. I learned better how to refactor and format an html webpage as well as a stylesheet.
I ended up also learning a lot about how semantic elements are organized and the standard methods of organizing them.
